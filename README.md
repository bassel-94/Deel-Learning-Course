# Deep-Learning-Course
Deep learning course deals with the following problems in the form of tutorials:
- Compare classifiers like Random Forests, KNN, Random Trees and LDA. 
- Use cross validation techniques to tune some hyperparameters
- Use Support Vector Machines and tune its hyperparameters. Apply on digit recognition data
- Build a single layer perceptron from scratch and test it on generated data
- Use Neuralnet package to build a neural network and test it on generated data
